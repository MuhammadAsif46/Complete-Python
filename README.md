## Python Installation and Setup

To start coding in Python, you need to install Python on your computer.

üîπ Download the latest version of Python from the official website:  
üëâ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

üîπ Installers are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

üîπ While installing on Windows, make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"** during the setup process.

üîπ After installation, verify it by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## Running Python on Linux

Most Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) come with Python pre-installed.

üîπ To check if Python is already installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

üîπ If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:

- For Debian/Ubuntu based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

- For Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```

üîπ After installation, verify by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

‚úÖ Now you can run Python programs using:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Your First Python Program

Let's write and run your very first Python programs! üéâ

In Python, the `print()` function is used to display output on the screen.

Here are some basic examples:

```python
print(200)            # Prints the number 200
print("Hello World")  # Prints the text Hello World
print(10 * 5)         # Prints the result of 10 multiplied by 5 (i.e., 50)
print(10 % 3)         # Prints the remainder when 10 is divided by 3 (i.e., 1)
```

### How to run:

1. Open your code editor or terminal.
2. Save the code in a file named first.py.
3. Run the program:

- For Windows:

```bash
python first.py
```

- For Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 first.py
```

## Comments in Python

- Single-line comment example:

```bash
# Printing a number
print(200)

#  Printing a text message
print("Hello World")

# Printing the sum of two numbers
print(10 + 5)

# Printing the product of two numbers
print(10 * 3)

```

- Multi-line comment example:

```bash
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
You can use triple single quotes ('''or''') or triple double quotes (""" or """)
to write comments that span multiple lines.
'''
```

## Variables

üîπ How to create a variable in Python:

```python
name = "Asif"
age = 22
price = 499.99
is_active = True
```
üîπ Roles of Variables:

- Store information (like numbers, text, etc.)
- Make code readable and organized
- Allow reuse of values without repeating
- Help in doing calculations and data processing easily

‚úÖ In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable ‚Äî Python automatically figures it out based on the assigned value.

---

## Data Types

Data types represent the kind of data a variable holds. 
Each value in Python has a specific type.

üîπ Common Data Types in Python:

- **int** ‚Äî Integer numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 200)
- **float** ‚Äî Decimal numbers (e.g., 10.5, 3.14)
- **str** ‚Äî Strings/Text (e.g., "Hello", "Python")
- **bool** ‚Äî Boolean (True or False)
- **list** ‚Äî Ordered collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
- **tuple** ‚Äî Immutable ordered collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
- **dict** ‚Äî Key-Value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Asif", "age": 22})
- **set** ‚Äî Unordered unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})

üîπ Examples:
```bash
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 20.5

# String
name = "Asif"

# Boolean
is_active = True

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Asif", "age": 22}
```

‚úÖ Python automatically sets the type when you assign a value.

### How to Check the Type of a Variable
In Python, you can use the type() function to check what type of data a variable holds.

üîπ Example:
```bash
x = 10
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>

y = "Hello"
print(type(y))   # Output: <class 'str'>
```
‚úÖ type() function helps you understand what kind of value a variable is storing.

## Arithmetic Operations

In Python, arithmetic operations are used to perform basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Description        | Example     | Output  |
|:---------|:--------------------|:------------|:--------|
| `+`      | Addition             | `5 + 3`     | `8`     |
| `-`      | Subtraction          | `5 - 3`     | `2`     |
| `*`      | Multiplication       | `5 * 3`     | `15`    |
| `/`      | Division             | `5 / 2`     | `2.5`   |
| `//`     | Floor Division       | `5 // 2`    | `2`     |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)  | `5 % 2`     | `1`     |
| `**`     | Exponent (Power)     | `2 ** 3`    | `8`     |

#### Examples:

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # 13
print(a - b)   # 7
print(a * b)   # 30
print(a / b)   # 3.333...
print(a // b)  # 3
print(a % b)   # 1
print(a ** b)  # 1000
```
