## Python Installation and Setup

To start coding in Python, you need to install Python on your computer.

üîπ Download the latest version of Python from the official website:  
üëâ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

üîπ Installers are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

üîπ While installing on Windows, make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"** during the setup process.

üîπ After installation, verify it by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

## Running Python on Linux

Most Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) come with Python pre-installed.

üîπ To check if Python is already installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

üîπ If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:

- For Debian/Ubuntu based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

- For Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```

üîπ After installation, verify by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

‚úÖ Now you can run Python programs using:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```
