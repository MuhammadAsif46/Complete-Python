## Python Installation and Setup

To start coding in Python, you need to install Python on your computer.

üîπ Download the latest version of Python from the official website:  
üëâ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

üîπ Installers are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

üîπ While installing on Windows, make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"** during the setup process.

üîπ After installation, verify it by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

## Running Python on Linux

Most Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) come with Python pre-installed.

üîπ To check if Python is already installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

üîπ If Python is not installed, you can install it using the package manager:

- For Debian/Ubuntu based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

- For Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```

üîπ After installation, verify by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

‚úÖ Now you can run Python programs using:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

## Your First Python Program

Let's write and run your very first Python programs! üéâ

In Python, the `print()` function is used to display output on the screen.

Here are some basic examples:

```python
print(200)            # Prints the number 200
print("Hello World")  # Prints the text Hello World
print(10 * 5)         # Prints the result of 10 multiplied by 5 (i.e., 50)
print(10 % 3)         # Prints the remainder when 10 is divided by 3 (i.e., 1)
```
### How to run:
1. Open your code editor or terminal.
2. Save the code in a file named first.py.
3. Run the program:

- For Windows:
```bash
python first.py
```

- For Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 first.py
```
